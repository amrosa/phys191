                  Problem 1 Assess: Is your answer reasonable? How do you know this? One suggestion is to compare to the problem in the lecture. Also, if you look at your algebraic expression, you should see that if $H=D\tan\theta$, the value of $v_0$ becomes infinite. This means that if you aim the ball along the straight line connecting it to the goalposts, it's impossible to make the shot. Is this reasonable?

                  Do your units work out? Did you actually check and make sure they cancel out correctly?

                  <li>What is one thing you understand better than you did before after working with your group? </li>

                  <li>What is a reasonable plan for me to clear up points that I'm still unsure about? Answers for this might be sticking around after class to ask questions, go on Piazza, office hours, look up the relevant sections in the book.</li>
